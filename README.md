# Candy-Crush
I made a very basic candy crush in c++.
Using a .h file provided by my professor in first semester. 
The project consisted of 3, 4 and 5 shapes matching. Different shapes have different colors.
In order to swap you have to press space and then press any key among left, right, up and down.
You only have 10 chances of swapping.
If you swap wrong it’ll result in decrement of your chances.
If 3 candies match then it’ll give 100 points.
If 4 candies match then it’ll give 200 points.
If 5 candies match then it’ll give 300 points.
And if your score become greater than or equal to 1100 then you are the winner otherwise you’ll lose.
